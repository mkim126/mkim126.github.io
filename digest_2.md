This is after explaining to a friend
and talking to her about the topic

[1]Electrical stimulation to the brain to send
neurotransmitters to your leg to force your brain

Deep brain stimulation: magnetic coil- magnetic waves
	transcranial magnetic stimulation

optogenetics
    *these are research that has been
    done that is similar to the Reverse
    paralysis; haven't researched too
    much on it yet.

optogenetics
  Nancy Kanwisher-one of the first people
  to use fMRI
  Prosopagnosia: sudden loss of ability
  to recognize faces
  brain comprises general-purpose
  machinery as well as more specialized
  components.
  fMRI and electrical stimulation allowed
  Kanwisher's team to establish which
  part of the brain is selectively involved
  in a specific mental process
  many specialized areas in the brain can be
  identified.

 Optogenetics is a biological technique which involves the use of light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels.
 			basically controlling the brain with light
					 technique in neuroscience in which genes for light-sensitive proteins are introduced into specific types of brain cells in order to monitor and control their activity precisely using light signals.
