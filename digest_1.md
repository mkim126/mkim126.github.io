# Reverse Paralysis
is a technology that uses an implant to restore the freedom of movement that spinal cord injuries take away. It is connecting brain-reading technology to the electrical simulators on the body.
It was tested on a monkey that had its spinal cord damaged which left its right leg paralyzed. The implant read the monkey’s intention to move and transmitted it in the form of electrical stimulation to its spine. This abled the monkey to start moving its right leg.

# Switzerland Trial
	Gregoire Courtine(professor of neuroprosthetics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne[EPFL])
	She started conducting these trials on rats for almost 15 years before taking the first steps for humans.
“This miraculous feat was possible because the rat’s nervous system adapted to its injury with the help of the stimulation and training; the few nerve fibers around the spinal cord injury that had been spared from damage regrew and reorganized to bring commands from the rat’s brain to its legs.”
	She moved to monkeys before finally going to humans. The patients would have to train to walk. She used a more upgraded version of a harness that the rats would use to train. Courtine stated:
	“In rats and non-human primates, we see reorganization not just at site of injury, but throughout the nervous system,” he says. “The brain finds new ways to communicate with the spinal cord below the injury.”
	“The first person to get the spinal implant is a man who suffered a spinal cord injury five years ago that left him partially paralyzed. Before the implant, he was able to walk with support, but the stimulating implant drastically improved his gait. “When we turn on the stimulation, the movement is much more coordinated,” Courtine says. The trial will involve eight patients, with later patients having more severe injuries and higher levels of paralysis.”
  "This new interface involves two main implants -- one sensor in the brain and a nerve stimulator in the spine -- located on either side of the injury to bridge the line of communication."

 # CNBC
(March 28, 2017)
CNBC shares a story about a man who had been paralyzed from the shoulders down
	He was able to move enough to eat drink on his own with the help of a new “neuro-prosthetic” device.
	This is an ongoing study by the BrainGate system.
	They put a brain implant that was made of 2 tiny electrodes that sat beneath the skull. They also planted 36 electrodes in Bill Kochevar’s arm(this stimulated various muscles). The Two pieces from the implant was connected to a computer and that translated the brain signals into commands for the electrodes on the arm.
	It took about a total of four months for Kochevar to train the system to recognize his brain signals to indicate the action he wanted to take.
After a total of 12 months, he was able to use the device to feed himself.
	The limitations of this device is that he had to watch his arms as he moved it.
